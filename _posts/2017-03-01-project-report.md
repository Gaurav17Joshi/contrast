You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

## Astronomy Behind the Data:

Analysis of Quasi Periodicities is important in understanding the dynamic of many Astrophysical objects during transient events like:

1) Gamma Ray Bursts

2) Solar Flares

3) Magnetar Flares

4) X Ray Binaries

### 1) Gamma Ray Bursts:

**Pulsars** are rapidly rotating Neutron Stars, which coupled with their strong magnetic field launches two opposite beams of Electromagnetic Radiation. These beams sweep around as the star moves and we on earth see it as a pulse of increased brightness in lightcurves. These radiations can be in the Radio, Visible or X-Ray Spectrum. 

### 2) Giant Magnetar Flares:

**Magnetars** are a special class of Neutron Stars with extremely strong magnetic fields. They are rarer and have short lifetimes, as their intense magnetic fields slow down their spinning rate over time (also weakening the field).

They are known to emit short bursts of X-Rays and Gamma Rays called Giant Magnetar Bursts. The most widely believed theory is that these bursts are caused by the with magnetic coupling of the crust to the core.
In the Neutron Star, the Crust and the Magnetic Field are locked together so a change in one affects the other. The crust of the star is under incredible strain due to the intense gravity and rapid rotation. When the crust reaches its breaking point, it can crack and release energy in the form of a flare. This process might be similar to earthquakes on Earth and is called a star quake.

In a fraction of a secound a Mangnetar can release more energy than the Sun can in a quater million years. This radiation is majorly in the X and Gamma Ray Spectrum. SGR 1806-20 is a magnetar in our galaxy, which released a burst of gamma rays in 2004, which was so powerful that it was detected by the earth's atmosphere, despite being 50,000 light years away.
